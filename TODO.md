# Fair Use Policy Implementation for CloudNest

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive fair use policy to ensure equitable resource distribution and prevent abuse. This includes bandwidth limits, API rate limiting, usage warnings, and fair resource allocation across users.

## Information Gathered
- Current system has basic storage limits (Pro: 20GB, Free: 2GB)
- File size limits (Pro: 5GB, Free: 100MB)
- Free users limited to 3 files per folder and 30-day retention
- No bandwidth or API rate limiting currently implemented
- Files track download/view counts and timestamps
- Admin can monitor storage usage

## Plan
### 1. Bandwidth Limiting
- [ ] Add bandwidth tracking per user per month
- [ ] Implement download speed throttling for heavy users
- [ ] Set monthly bandwidth quotas (Pro: 100GB, Free: 10GB)

### 2. API Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement request rate limits (e.g., 100 requests/minute per user)
- [ ] Add burst handling for legitimate traffic spikes
- [ ] Different limits for different endpoints (upload vs download)

### 3. Usage Warnings and Notifications
- [ ] Add storage usage warnings at 80% and 95% capacity
- [ ] Implement bandwidth usage notifications
- [ ] Email alerts for approaching limits

### 4. Fair Resource Allocation
- [ ] Implement priority queuing for uploads/downloads
- [ ] Add fair scheduling for resource-intensive operations
- [ ] Monitor and prevent resource hogging

### 5. Enhanced Analytics
- [ ] Track bandwidth usage per user
- [ ] Add usage patterns analysis
- [ ] Implement usage forecasting

## Dependent Files to be edited
- `backend/models/User.js` - Add bandwidth and rate limit fields
- `backend/models/File.js` - Add bandwidth tracking
- `backend/controllers/fileController.js` - Implement bandwidth checks and throttling
- `backend/midddleware/rateLimitMiddleware.js` - New middleware for API rate limiting
- `backend/controllers/adminController.js` - Update settings and analytics
- `backend/routes/fileRoutes.js` - Apply rate limiting middleware

## Followup steps
- [ ] Install required dependencies (express-rate-limit, node-cron)
- [ ] Test rate limiting and bandwidth controls
- [ ] Implement notification system
- [ ] Update frontend to show usage warnings
- [ ] Monitor system performance under load
